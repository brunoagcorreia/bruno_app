Now, type the following to let Git know to track this repository:

$ git init
Let Git know to track all the files currently in here:

$ git add .
Looks like nothing happened. To see what did happen, type this:

$ git status

$ git remote add origin https://github.com/my_user_name/my_new_app_name.git
There’s no obvious result, so let’s type the following to make sure we got that right:

$ git remote -v
You should see something like this:

$ origin https://github.com/my_user_name/my_new_app.git (fetch)
$ origin https://github.com/my_user_name/my_new_app.git (push)
Now for the moment of truth! Type this to push your entire app to GitHub:

git push origin master

When you pushed to GitHub, you might have noticed the following line show up in your terminal:

$ * [new branch] master -> master
If you missed it, type this into your terminal:

$ git branch
You should see this:

$ * master

You'll need to run `bundle install` every time you make changes to your gemfile
