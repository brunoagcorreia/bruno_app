installing/login

$ git config --global user.name "brunoagcorreia"

$ git config -l

Now, type the following to let Git know to track this repository:

$ git init
Let Git know to track all the files currently in here:

$ git add .
Looks like nothing happened. To see what did happen, type this:

$ git status

$ git remote add origin https://github.com/my_user_name/my_new_app_name.git
There’s no obvious result, so let’s type the following to make sure we got that right:

$ git remote -v
You should see something like this:

$ origin https://github.com/my_user_name/my_new_app.git (fetch)
$ origin https://github.com/my_user_name/my_new_app.git (push)
Now for the moment of truth! Type this to push your entire app to GitHub:

git push origin master

When you pushed to GitHub, you might have noticed the following line show up in your terminal:

$ * [new branch] master -> master
If you missed it, type this into your terminal:

$ git branch
You should see this:

$ * master

Rails has a specific tool for making changes to the database structure called migrations.
Every time you want to create a new table, delete a table, or modify the structure of an existing table,
you need to generate a file called a `database migration` using the `rails generate migration` command.
You can then use the `rails db:migrate` command to run the migration and update the database structure
(we will repeat this process several times, so you will eventually have it memorized).


rails generate migration add_brand_to_intruments brand:string

database migrations

we can use `seeds.rb` file to create products. Inside that file, add:

Product.create(name: "seed-generated product", description: "I also created this product without using the HTML form!")

Save the file. Then, in the terminal, run rails db:seed.
